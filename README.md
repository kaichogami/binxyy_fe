### Capex Overview
To asses how much money is being spent on new stuff we need to look at two things.
* Capex
    * Capex per year
    * Capex yoy growth
    * Capex industry yoy growth

* Capex to Sales ratio
    * Ratio over the years compared to industry

* Total Fixed assets
    * Fixed assest growth
    * Compare with industry

* Depreciation over the years
    * Depreceiation growth
    * Compare with industry


This will tell if company is spending on stuff for future capacity expansion including diving into AI world.

But is the company profitable enough in allocating the new money? Lets look at its
* Debt to equity ratio
* Operating Margin
* ROIC
* Free cash

And how would it fund itself?
* Debt to equity ratio
* Free cash flow

-------------------------------------

### capital intensive?
* Which capital intensive? Sales / factor where factors are
    * Fixed assest
    * total assest
    * Total debt
    * total equity
    * WOrking capital
    * Average capital emploeyed(fixed assest + working capital of many years)
* Raw data required
    * Sales, fixed assest, total assest, total debt, total equity
* Calculated data required
    * Working capital
    * Total Capital employed

--------------------------------------

### Sustainable cash flow
* Find operating cashflow
* Compare with operating profit - depreciation.
* Find average operating cashflow over the years.
* This is the sustainable cashflow
* Find average cash flow return on capital employed.

* Raw data required
    * Operating cash flow

* Calculated data
    * Total capital employed
    * Average cash flow over the years
    * Average cash flow return on capital employed

-----------------------------------
### Revenue
* Revenue over the years.
* Revenue growth
* Revenue CAGR
* Compare with industry

* Raw Data required
    * Revenue

* calculated data required
    * Revenue growth industry
    * Revenue cagr industry

### Value of Revenue

* Market cap / Revenue over the years
* Compare with industry
* If higher PS ratio then each revenue for that industry is more valuable to shareholders

* Raw data required
    * market cap
    * revenue
* Calculated data
    * PS ratio of stock and insutry

### Cost of Revenue
* Cost over the years
* Cost / revenue over the years
* Compare with industry

* Raw data
    * cost of revenue
    * revenue
* Calculated data
    * Cost / Revenue of stock and industry    
----------------------------------


### Assest distribution
* current assest / total assest
* long term assest / total assest
* Accounts receivable / current assest
* Inventory / current assest
* PP&E / long term assest
* Long term investment / long term assest
* Deferred tax / long term assest


* Raw data required
    * total assest
    * Current assest
    * Inventory
    * PP&E
    * Long term investment
    * Deferred tax
    * long term assest

---------------------------------------

### Working Capital Distribution
* 


### Owner's Earnings
* Owner’s Earnings=Net Income+Non-Cash Charges−Maintenance Capital Expenditures
* Or owners earnings = operating cash flow - maintence capex
* CAlculate maintenence capex using Bruce Greenwald's maintence capex calculation
* Find the owner's earnings over the years and compare with industry with owner_earning / sales metric.

* Raw data
    * Operating cash flow
    * revenue
    * Capex

* Calculated data
    * Capex / sales
    * Average capex / sales (This is the growth capex %)
    * Growth capex = capex * growth capex
    * maintanenece capex = capex - growth capex
    * owner earning = operating cash flow - maintaince capex

--------------------------------------

### Red flags
* Account receivablese growth greater than sales
* Declining cash flow

--------------------------------------






Cost will come down. There are atleast 2 ideas I can use to support this
1) Cost per MIPS(Million instructions per second) came down drastically from 1980s to 1990s
The gneeral purpose CPU cost efficientcy is measured by this. When world shifted from mainframe to PC that we know now, industry went from vertical to horizontal. Vertical meaning one copany produced everything from chips to software to distrutbution. Horizont is when company realised its more affective to product just one thing really well. So we now have specialised companies for chips, OS, software, distribution and suppliers. At the moment GPU is produced mainly by one company and its good because CUDA and the chips work really together. Why is why AMD is not getting as much traction as Nvdia. 
Eventually company will realise its btter to seperate stuff as much as its economical and drive down the cost. How the seperation will exsist no one can know now. But one of the most stragithforward way is to reduce the cost per FLOPS(processing unit for GPU). Each part of the whole which is responsible for driving the cost per FLOPs will be optimised.

 See diagram for cost per MIPS I stole from a book. 


2) Capital will be attracted to avenue making high return(most likely gen AI related industry) and fill it with overcapacity in the end of this cycle.
people invest money or resources where they expect maximum return. Since AI is a strategic inflation(or a factor with 100x change) in tech sector money is changing hand rapidly to find place for maximum return. In this process a natural thing to do is to reduce cost so that profit margin increases. ANd to reduce cost newer ways wlil come forth to produce one unit of AI computation at cheapest price. 

Both computer history and capital cycle theory fits nicely to explain why GPU cost is not going to be a problem in just few years. Maybe the cloud cost will come down or personally owned GPUs. For consumer like us its probably better if physcally component price decreases and also for companies who are going to integrate both software and hardware in one package like robots or vehicles or phones
But for companies like AWS, Azure its probably better if cloud cost comes down more than their hardware. No one knows what will happen in exact detail.
